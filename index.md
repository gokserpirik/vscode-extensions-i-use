# My Extension Recommendations for VSCode
### Some of them also the ones that I use in my projects. So if you use them it's also better for you to see my comments and code better than now.

## Extensions for Code View

### Better Comments
I use Better Comments to give specific messages in my comments for you and I.
For example, if I use "!" , it means that part is important.
Also, I can redefine "!" at the start of the project, so when you read that definition, you can easily understand my comments' main point before reading them.

### Flutter (includes DART)
My profiles is mostly based on Flutter. I also write my code in VSCode. Therefore, this extension helps me a lot! It has fast debug option which can work from VSCode's interface without any code. Also you can easily open performance pages and such.

### Github Theme
I like this extension because of its variety. There are many color options that are not boring and good-looking.
